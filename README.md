**09-Challenge-README-Generator**

In this weeks challenge, I was tasked with creating a README generator using Node.js, which I have been able to successfully produce.

This challenge does not have a deployable application, as it is ran from the command line of a users computer.

From my repository, click on:

Code > Download as ZIP File > Open the application in VSC > run `node index.js` in the command line either using VSC or the device's own.

Here is a link to a video showcasing the final result of the challenge:
